This file bikeshare.py is all about: Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
In this project, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 
This program show how to compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

Note: Since this program was developed in local computer, assumption is that you have the files to be situated  in appropriate directory of your local machine to have the python program run successfully.
